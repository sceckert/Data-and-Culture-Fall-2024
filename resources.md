### Off-the-Shelf Humanities Data Tools

+ [**Corpus Linguistics in Context (CLiC)**](https://clic.bham.ac.uk/): a project originally created for analyzing patterns in direct speech, narration, and speech tags, which now features full text for several small sample collections of 19th-century British novels, 19th-century African American novels, and 19th-century children's literature.
	+ [Quick Start Guide](https://blog.bham.ac.uk/clic-dickens/2022/06/15/clic-quick-start-guide/)

	+ Texts [currently available to work with in CLiC](https://github.com/mahlberg-lab/corpora/blob/master/INDEX.pdf)
+ [**Voyant Tools**](https://voyant-tools.org/): a dashboard for uploading your own collection of either plain text or XML files. The dashboard includes two demo collections: Project Gutenberg versions of Jane Austen's novels and Williams Shakespeare's plays, but the tool can be used with any plain text collection (or even on single texts).
	+ My [quick tutorial](https://github.com/sceckert/Data-and-Culture-Fall-2024/tree/main/_week6/Eckert-Text-Analysis-Introduction-to-Voyant.pdf) using the demo Austen novels corpus (1790-1818) and our corpus of U.S. Inaugural Addresses (1789-2021)

(For work published before 1929, these texts are fully available, for texts after 1929, only the metadata is publicly accessible) . For an overview of what's actually in HathiTrust, scroll through this [interactive visualization](https://creatingdata.us/datasets/hathi-features/) by Ben Schmidt to get a sense of what's in HathiTrust. HathiTrust Bookworm is little like GoogleBooks Ngram Viewer, with many more ways of moving from the distant overview of the visualization to particular titles. The Bookworm Playground offers other
