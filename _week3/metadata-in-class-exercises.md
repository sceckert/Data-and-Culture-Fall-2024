# In Class Practicum: Week 3


Let's try making structured and unstructured data!

In groups below,  you’re going to be looking at some kind of textual source, and figuring out how what choices you would make to turn it into structured (or semi-structured) data. 



## Group 1:
Let’s say you want to create a dataset drawing from a complicated primary source like the Evelyn College Course Catalogue (1890-1897), linked here catalogue: https://bit.ly/2ZrhSJk 

Create a mock mini spreadsheet with fields that you might use if you wanted to turn this set of catalogs into structured data. **Your job will be to create some fields that  we could use comparing the types of courses in each department*** LINK TO SHEET HERE: https://tinyurl.com/5cotzuob

As you work, think about the following:

- What kind of "metadata" is present here?
- If you had to record some of this data in a Google spreadsheet, what choices would you make? What might make it difficult?
- What do we do with information that is present in one catalogue, but not in others?
- What are the different ways we could categorize this curricular information?


## Group 2:
Let’s say you want to create a dataset drawing from a complicated primary source like the Evelyn College Course Catalogue (1890-1897), linked here catalogue: https://bit.ly/2ZrhSJk 

Create a mock mini spreadsheet with fields that you might use if you wanted to turn this set of catalogs into structured data. **Your job will be to create some fields that we could use to compare how the distribution requirements changed over time.** LINK TO SHEET HERE: https://tinyurl.com/3obrj5jg


As you work, think about the following:

- What kind of "metadata" is present here?
- If you had to record some of this data in a Google spreadsheet, what choices would you make? What might make it difficult?
- What do we do with information that is present in one catalogue, but not in others?
- What are the different ways we could categorize this curricular information?

## Group 3:

Look back at the [US inaugural addresses dataset](https://github.com/sceckert/Data-and-Culture-Fall-2024/blob/main/_datasets/US_Inaugural_Addresses.zip?raw=true) that we worked with for Homework 3. Right now all of these text files are unstructured plain text. 

Create a plan for how you might turn these addresses into either structured (eg a spreadsheet with fields) or semi-structured data (eg a series of text files with tags, like [TEI](https://www.teibyexample.org/exist/examples/TBED01v00.htm)) with fields or tags that you might use  & how you might use them.

As you work, think about the following:

- What kind of "metadata" is present here?
- Why did you choose the format (structured or semi-structuredstructured) that you did?
- What aspects of these text files would you want to mark or tag?
- If you had to tag some elements of each speech what would you tag? What might make it difficult? What insight might it provide?
- If you wanted to create structured data about these speeches, what fields might you include? What information do you wish you had and why?

## Group 4:

Look back at the two Gertrude Stein pieces –– ["Matisse" and "Picasso"](https://wesmoodle.wesleyan.edu/pluginfile.php/1732081/mod_resource/content/0/stein-matisse-and-picasso.pdf) from Week 2. 

Create a plan for how you would encode either of these texts as semi-structured data––like the example of the piece of play by Shakespeare. (Take a look at [the TEI guide for some of the basics](https://www.teibyexample.org/exist/examples/TBED01v00.htm) Don't worry about getting the exact right tag––remember, these schemas are flexible: the main idea.)

As you work, think about the following:

- What kind of "metadata" is present here?
- What would I want to tag and label for the computer––are they formal features? Material features like format and layout? Provenance and publication? Linguistic features? 
- What aspects of these text files would you want to mark or tag?
- If you had to tag some elements of each piece of writing, what would you tag? What might make it difficult? What insight might it provide?
- If you wanted to create structured data about these addresses, what fields might you include? What information do you wish you had and why?
