# Developing Research Questions with Wesleyan Special Collections & Archives Data

On Monday, we looked at five different collections in Wesleyan Special Collections & Archives. For this exercise, we're going to spend a little more time with your collections data.

## Part 1

The catalog records that we were working with contained catalog records. In addition to metadata about that book in Wesleyan's Collections, many catalog records contain fields that describe the book according to *descriptive bibliography*. This is a little different than the kind of bibliography at the end of piece of scholarship (an *enumerative* bibliography).  

> _Descriptive bibliography_ may be defined as the close physical description of books and other printed objects: a systematic report concerning their type, paper, printing, illustrations, and binding, and how the circumstances of their publication and distribution may have affected their physical appearance. Typically, the bibliographical description of a book produced during the hand-press period (before about 1800) begins with a statement regarding its **format** (the relationship between the _sheets_ of paper on which it was printed and the individual _leaves_ created when the sheets were folded into _gatherings_) and **collational formula** (a condensed statement describing the number of leaves per gathering, the manner in which the gatherings were signed and the leaves paginated, and the order in which the gatherings were intended to be bound). The **formulary** is followed by descriptions of the book's _paper_, _typography_, and letterpress _contents_; its plates, maps, or other inserted _illustrative matter_; and its _binding_ (esp. if executed by the publisher before sale to the public); regulatory circumstances (eg _licenses_ or _privileges_). The description typically concludes with relevant details of the book's _authorship_, _publication_ and _distribution_.

In your groups, take a look at at the following resources for your collection. 

+ What else do we notice about your collection data?
+ What research question would you be interested in exploring?
+ What steps might you take to explore?

## Part 2

Now that you've had a chance to think through some of the data and what might interest you, try and come up with some specific questions that you (as a group and individually, would be interested in working on)
