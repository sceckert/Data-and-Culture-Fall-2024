### REQUIRED TEXTS ## 

Almost all the readings will be available online through either our course website or as PDFs Moodle. When we are reading PDFs, please print them out.

**CoursePack:** Starting in Week 4, a pack of our readings will be available for purchase. You do not need to purchase the CoursePack, if you choose not to, please print out the readings yourself. 

My one recommended reading is Dennis Tenen's *Literary Theory for Robots* (Norton, 2023). We'll have PDF excerpts available, but I highly encourage you to find a print copy. The book should be available at RJ Julia or on Powells, Amazon, etc. If you experience any difficulty in obtaining a copy of this text, or if purchasing the book poses any financial burden, please let me know and we can make arrangements.

### ATTENDANCE & PARTICIPATION

As this is a discussion-based seminar, active participation is essential.  Part of your responsibility to the seminar is to arrive on time, to complete the reading and exercise, and to be prepared to engage in class discussions and activities. I understand that life happens. If you must miss class, please try to let me know in advance. More than three unexcused absences will affect your grade.

### COVID PROTOCOOL

If you test positive for COVID, please stay home! 


### CLASSROOM CULTURE

**Etiquette**: So that we can better facilitate class discussions and thinking together, I'll ask that we try to follow a few guidelines:

- Aim to contribute thoughtfully to discussion at least once every class. 
	- I know speaking in front of others can be intimidating. If you are uncomfortable speaking in front of your peers, or consider class participation to be a struggle for you for any reason, please bring this up in office hours early in the semester so that we can work together to improve your skills and set some goals.
- You should expect to arrive on time and ready to engage in class discussions and exercises.
- During discussion:
	- Listen and respond directly to your classmates (by name). Look at them, not just me.
	- Respond to and acknowledge your peers’ contributions
	- When making a claim, always bring in specific examples from our readings or discussion to support your claim.
- *Take space / make space*
	- if you feel you contributed a lot, take a step back and make space for others 
	- if you have not contributed yet, try and get more engaged.

***Etiquette (Classroom & Email):*** Refer to your classmates by name. Try not to make assumptions about gender pronouns. Whenever you email me or a classmate, keep it cordial. Include a greeting and your name at the end.

**Distractions & Learning on Laptops:** Because we will be on our screens in this course, it's very important to create an atmosphere that minimizes distraction. During our class sessions––whether we're in discussion or in group or solo work––please close all browser windows except those with our course materials. Please, no scrolling through Instagram, checking your email, or messaging your friends.

### LATE WORK
You may have up to 3 extensions, provided that you request them in advance. For weekly homework, since the assignments build upon one another, you may have up to 48 hrs to turn them in. Assignments turned in outside these parameters will be penalized by 10% each day it is late.


## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

Plagiarism is a very serious offense. It includes both the direct copying of the words of another person without crediting him or her and paraphrasing the ideas of another person without giving credit. You are required to adhere to the [Wesleyan University Honor Code](https://www.wesleyan.edu/studentaffairs/studenthandbook/honor-code.html). In short: don’t cheat. 

We will be thinking carefully about generative AI (how it works). In general, for your written work, exercise, and writing, I will ask that you not use Generative AI like ChatGPT and other generative text modeling for your written work and code. (We'll discuss more of this in the course of the class. Note that may have some controlled exercises with generative AI, but this will be for demonstrative purposes only).

In this course we will be engaging in many different forms of work, including individual writing and coding as well as collaborative work with your classmates. In all of these cases, it is vital to give credit to others for their work. If you're ever in doubt about whether or not you need to cite or give credit––whether that source is a course project or a classmate or course discussion––always err on the side of citation! We will talk about how best to cite and give appropriate credit for different kinds of intellectual labor over the course of the semester.  If you need help, see the instructor.
