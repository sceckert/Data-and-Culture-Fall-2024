## The Form of Detective Fiction in the *Strand*

Experiment 1. First, as a pair, take a look at Sidney Paget's illustrations for Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories below (Click on the links provided by the *Victorian Web*). What patterns do we notice? 

+ [Holmes and Watson together - according to Sidney Paget](https://victorianweb.org/art/illustration/pagets/together.html)
+ [Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, and railways — according to Sidney Paget](https://victorianweb.org/art/illustration/pagets/rr.html)

Experiment 2. Then, working in pairs, select **two Sherlock Holmes stories from *The Strand* magazine and compare FIRST PAGES of the stories.** (Click on the links provided by Victorian Voices to access the PDF facsimiles of each story) What sorts of patterns do we notice? How do the openings of two stories compare to each other? To "A Scandal in Bohemia" and "The Man with the Twisted Lip"?

### Food for future research: Experiment 3

We might ask similar questions about the form the other fiction that appeared (including stories from the series *Stories from the Diary of a Doctor*, *Martin Hewitt, Investigator*, *Romances from a Detective's Casebook*, and others). We might look for other kinds of formal patterns––even something as simple as how the story opens––and compare across work in the Strand. [Note: Fiction didn't always advertise itself clearly as "detective" or mystery– you might think about what other work the title does (or doesn't do) to signal the genre.]  

Let's examine the [list of all fiction published in the Strand between 1891-1901 (assembled on *At the Circulating Library*)](https://www.victorianresearch.org/atcl/show_periodical.php?jid=122)

We could also look at select list of individual volumes of the Strand (each of which include 6 months of magazine installments) indexed on Victorian Voices:
