- Rutgers University Libraries list of [datasets generated from their collections](https://rutgersdh.github.io/dh-sources/) that are relevant for digital humanities research

### Other humanities data resources 

- [*The Pudding*'s repository of data](https://github.com/the-pudding/data#data-sets) connected to their data journalism stories
	- A heads up: with *The Pudding*, you'll want to be careful to say something new about the data beyond the original story that the dataset was assembled for. 
-  Jeremy Singer (an independent data journalist) also has running dataset newsletter called *Data is Plural*. You can view the [archive of datasets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0) or browse the newsletter archive [here](https://www.data-is-plural.com/). 
	- A heads up: unlike the more curated sets of humanities data above, these datasets lists are in varied formats, and come with *varying* levels of contextual detail.
