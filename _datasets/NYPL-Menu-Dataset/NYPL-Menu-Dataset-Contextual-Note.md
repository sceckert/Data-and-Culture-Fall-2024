# NYPL Menu Dataset Contextual Note

This dataset is downloaded from the data export of the New York Public Library’s Menu Dataset project, ["What's on the Menu?"](http://menus.nypl.org/data). The NYPL's massive menu collection — tens of thousands of transcribed menus and menu items from the 1840s to the present. 

This data was collected by the NYPL special collections and transcribed as part of the crowd-sourced *What's on the Menu?* project, funded by the NYPL and the National Endowment for the Humanities. 

This set of data include Dish, Menu, and Menu page data as of Sept 1, 2022. For the full dataset, including menu items, download [the zip file of the NYPL Menu Dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/menusdata.nypl.org/gzips/2022_09_01_07_00_25_data.tgz), which is from the dataset's 09/01/22 update.
