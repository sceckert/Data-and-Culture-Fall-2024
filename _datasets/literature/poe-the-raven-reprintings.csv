A full page notice inserted in early copies of the first number of the new magazine, bearing the issue date of January 1845, notes that it was advertised to be available in September 1844, with the hope of enouraging subscribers. That date was missed, and it instead appeared in October, with the notice as an apology. The same notice states that although the second number would bear the date of February 1845, it would be issued Òearly in January.Ó The notice was commonly removed when individual issues were bound together as a volume, but several copies with the notice intact are known, including one in the Gimbel Collection of the Philadelphia Free Public Library.]",https://www.eapoe.org/works/info/pp073.htm,Magazine,"New York, NY",,40.7127281,-74.0060152,"40.7127281, -74.0060152"

At least one copy in wrappers has been seen, but even then it was collected with pages that would have been issued in previous months.

Had he authorized or requested the reprint, Poe would presumably have provided the most recent version, with a number of notable changes, rather than an earlier, inferior text. Because there is no clear designation of monthly issues in the volume, the presumed date of December 1845 is based on the reprint appearing at the end of the volume for 1845, although it appears that the remaining 5 issues were actually sent out in August 1845.
