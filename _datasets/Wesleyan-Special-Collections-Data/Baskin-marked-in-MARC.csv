"NI9WRY4L","book","184","American Sunday-School Union","Laura and Helen, or, The deaths of the school-mates","","","","","","One of a set of 50 volumes for children issued by the American Sunday-School Union in a glass-fronted walnut bookcase. The Child's cabinet library was listed in American Sunday-School Union catalogs from Jan. 1847 to at least 1870; it was not listed in 1893. All of the titles include wood-engraved illustrations and are uniformly bound in marbled boards with dyed-black sheep spines stamped and numbered in gold. Volumes 1-25 contain two stories each, each with separate title page and pagination; vol. 26-50 contain one story each. Most stories have title pages with publisher information but all are undated; publisher's address varies between 146, 316 and 1122 Chestnut St., indicating possible publication dates between 1826 and 1907. The Child{u2019}s Cabinet Library includes numerous moral stories as well as other works devoted to religious instruction, including catechisms and prayers. The texts are primarily in prose, but some titles are in verse and a few in dialogue form. Periodically, additional prayers, hymns, or devotional poems were also inserted at the end of a text.","0184","2024-10-29 15:24:37","2024-10-29 15:24:37","","","","","","","","","[The Child's home library","49","","","American Sunday-School Union","Philadelphia","eng","","","","","onesearch.wesleyan.edu","BV4571 .A1 no.49","","","","","","1846; Children's stories, American; Christian literature for children; Juvenile literature; Sunday school literature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
