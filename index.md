## Course Description

What does the mass digitization of the print cultural record mean for the making and study of literature, art, and culture?  This course introduces students to the critical and cultural study of data by introducing key debates around the meaning of data in the humanities. Like “slow food”––a movement where diners, farmers, and chefs rethink what and how we produce and consume––we will explore data as local, embedded, and requiring careful critical reflection. How can computational tools help us to understand art and literature? What do digital archives reveal (or obscure) about the people who make them? What kinds of writing have, historically, been seen as “uncreative” or automatable and what might this reveal about ideas of labor, gender, race, class, and computation? We will explore the foundations of this field while also discussing concerns that emerge when accessing and maintaining digital cultural artifacts in time and across global and local contexts.

Weekly readings will introduce concepts for understanding the cultures (and cultural artifacts) that produce and are produced by data and key techniques that humanities researchers use to organize, mediate, and analyze digital sources. This course will draw on a range of critical traditions, including history of the book, media studies, science & technology studies, computational literary studies, and critical data studies. Students will explore these methods through reflection papers, short code assignments, exercises in data curation and critique, and final projects. Course meetings will alternate between discussions and workshops with data from local libraries and special collections, including Olin Library Special Collections & Archives.

### Learning Objectives

In this class, you will:

- Develop the ability to make critical arguments about cultural data in the humanities––with particular attention to the layers of mediation that accompany the act of collecting, analyzing, and displaying data about literature, art, and culture
- Learn the fundamentals of cultural analytic work using the programming language Python
- Become familiar with some of the tools and techniques in digital humanities, from data collection and web-scraping to media history approaches to software interfaces.
