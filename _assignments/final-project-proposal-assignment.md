# Final Project Proposal 

The [final project](https://github.com/sceckert/Data-and-Culture-Fall-2024/blob/main/_assignments/final-project-assignment-prompt.md) proposal is the first stage of the project. It will take the form of a short write-up that will clearly and concretely describe your **questions**, **data**, **methods** and **plan** for the next few weeks as you prepare your project. (See link here for the full [final project promt](https://github.com/sceckert/Data-and-Culture-Fall-2024/blob/main/_assignments/final-project-assignment-prompt.md))

- What are your initial research questions?
- How you will translate your research questions into specific hypotheses or actionable steps?
- Which data and methods do you plan to use?  (be as specific and concrete as possible)
- What scholarship does your research draw upon and further? (This could be digital humanities scholarship, or broader questions in relevant humanities fields)
- How do you plan to communicate your findings? 

This jointly-written write-up should be **2-3 pages** and should lay the groundwork for the project, including  a **timeline** to completion of the data collection (what sources will you be using, in what format), analysis, and presentation/communication; and **a clear how you plan to equitably divide the work** required to make the project. You should make sure to include all names of project members.

NOTE: "Project" is deliberately left open-ended. Your project's "results" of your exploration of your dataset could take many forms, and the way you communicate them forum could be **a visualization** (hand-made or digital) and accompanying interpretation,  **an interactive Jupyter notebook**,  **an artist's book**,  **an exhibition**, a **video**, a **data physicalization or sonification**, or some-other creative format that you and your project team dream up.
