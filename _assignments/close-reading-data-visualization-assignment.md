# Close Reading a Data Visualization

In this assignment, you'll perform a short "close reading" of [a single data visualization that appears in one of the readings listed below](#choose-a-data-visualization-from-one-of-the-following-works). Your goal is to pay careful attention to the particular choices made in the visualization. Imagine you're an art historian describing the visualization as a physical object. What do you notice about it? How is it's put together, and the kind of arguments it is used to make. As a part of this assignment, you'll "cite" the graph by including the image at the top of your document. Your job is to notice even the slightest details about the graph––don't assume that just because you've included the document that a reader or viewer will notice the same things as you.

Questions your close reading should address:

- What does the visualization look like? 
    - Describe, in detail, like an art historian reading a painting, how this visualization appears: 
        - what forms does it use, what is it supposed to show?
        - What choices have they made – in color, graph type, data represented, scale, legend, labeling...
        - What are some possible implications of these choices (for viewer, for audience, etc)?
        - What is it purporting to show? How?
- How was the graph made? 
	- What data did were used? Where did they come from
	- Do we know what tools were used to make it?(Or, if this information isn't available, what might we make of that?)
- How is it used in the context of the writer's argument?
- What do you notice about the choices made in visualization?
- Based on what you've noticed in your reading, what's an argument that you might make *about* this graph?

- Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein, Data Feminism, Chapter 4: “What Gets Counted Counts” (2018) [Note that many of the data visualizations that they cite in this article come from other sources––you'll want to make a choice about whether you're using their citation of the graph, or the way the visualization was originally used]
- Anelise Shrout, “(Re)Humanizing Data: Digitally Navigating the Bellevue Almshouse” (2018)
- Hannah Anderson and Matt Daniels, "Film Dialogue from 2,000 Screenplays, Broken Down by Gender and Age" (2016)

You may also choose to work with one of the data visualizations that we've seen in class.


## What you'll turn in:

A short (2-3) pages double spaced) close reading of your data visualization. Include the original visualization, if possible, at the top of your analysis.  

If you've chosen a data visualization in a piece whose author already performs a close reading of the visualization (as in the case of D'Ignazio and Klein's "What Gets Counted Counts"), try and zero in on the aspects of the visualization that the piece does not discuss.
