#  Humanities Data Project Critique

For this assignment, you're going to write a short project review––or "critique"––of an existing humanities data project. Like the data biography, you'll be thinking about how a project works-–what choices were made in its sources, in processing those sources, in presenting and preserving them.  

Though the word ****"critique"*** (or its adjective form, "critical"), is often used in everyday speech to refer to negative judgments, the kind of critique you'll be writing is closer to the use of the word in the scholarly sense as a careful discussion of a work of scholarship (or art). Your goal in the review shouldn't be to ask whether a project is good or bad (a not-very-interesting question), but to explore how that project works––what choices were made in putting this project together?  What sorts of things result from those choices? What implications might they have? A good review should be able to communicate to a reader not just what a project set out to do, but the **way** that the project does so.

What your review should include:

- a brief summary of the humanities data project and its purpose
- a thoughtful discussion of the project's choices
	- You might think (building on Miriam Posner's "How Did They Build That") about
		- the project's stated or implicit audience 
		- the project's choice of sources
		- the project's choices in processing those sources
		- the project's argument (when applicable) about those sources
		- the project's choices in presentation (how the project shares its analysis, sources, or findings)
		- choices in preservation (how the project preserves its sources)
		- other choices in the methodology of the project
		
- an analysis of the implications of such choices.
	-  Think about this analysis as a series of questions about the choices
		- For instance, if a particular project has a counterintuitive interface, what sort of effect does that produce in you the reader/viewer? What effect might the project's team have been trying to produce?

- a discussion of interesting, lingering, or potentially thorny issues that emerge from the project (or the way it was )
