# Homework 6: Project brainstorming & practicing data collection 

This two-part homework is designed to give you time to brainstorming and collaborating on final projects as well as practice practice building and curating your own dataset around a specific research questions.

The only part that I ask that you turn is your project brainstorming post from part #1!

## Part 1: Project brainstorming!

1. Please **post at least one realistic project idea** that you'd be interested in (and sign your name) on [our project brainstorming GoogleDoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Co0Wni6ktOCFIwtMkq5aynPguGVLOkfbUBpAS-YR3_g/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.k217upgfhgy8)
	+ You might think about datasets we've worked with that you you were especially interested in, or example projects from the project critique that you found intriguing. Do you have a burning research question or data visualization that you would like to explore as part of your final project?
	+ Remember that your projects
2.  Please **also add one comment to another classmate's post** that you would be interested in collaborating on.

## Part 2: Collecting a mini dataset

**Practice collecting a small dataset**. You get to decide the focus: on a subset of Arthur Conan Doyle's detective fiction, on a subset of other work published in *The Strand*, a set of metadata, etc.  It can be a folder of plain text files on your computer, a spreadsheet with metadata about, a set of PDFs, a set of printed out images--let your research question 

Some suggestions: 

+ If you're interested in creating a collection of collection of plain text files–...
	+ You might download a set of plain text files of individual stories from Christoph Ender’s [“The Complete Sherlock Holmes Canon”](https://sherlock-holm.es/)
	+ You might download the plain text of Doyle's fiction published in book form from from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/69)
+ If you are interested in the Sherlock Holmes stories as they appeared  in *The Strand Magazine* 
	+ You may use [HathiTrust](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000642318) to download either plaintext or PDF versions of The *Strand Magazine* in HathiTrust libraries
		+ Link to the [locations of particular stories in HathiTrust](https://github.com/sceckert/Data-and-Culture-Fall-2024/blob/main/_week8/detective-fiction.md#sherlock-holmes-stories)
		+ To download the plain text of a page from HathiTrust, click on the "Download" button lefthand menu, and then select plain text. Repeat this step, selecting the PDF. 
		+ To download **more than one page**, check the squares in the upper righthand corner.
	+ You might consider:
		+ What if we wanted to analyze and compare just the language on first page of each of the twelve stories in *The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes* and *The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes*?
		+ What if we wanted to compare how the pieces appeared visually on the page-- the kinds of illustrations that appear? The scenes that are illustrated? (Do the kinds of scenes illustrated in Sherlock Holmes change over time––do we see more or less Holmes at Home)?
+ If you're interested in the other work (fiction, advertisements, poetry), other authors or illustrators that appeared in a given volume of *The Strand* alongside Doyle's fiction...
	+ You might examine the [list of all fiction published in the *Strand* between 1891-1901 (assembled by the *At the Circulating Library* team)](https://www.victorianresearch.org/atcl/show_periodical.php?jid=122)
	+  You might consult the indexes to particular *issues*  by looking at the [transcriptions of the tables of contents for individual issues of *The Strand*](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Strand_Magazine#Volumes_with_readable_content) on WikiSource
		+  Link to the [transcriptions of tables of contents for particular issues](https://github.com/sceckert/Data-and-Culture-Fall-2024/blob/main/_week8/detective-fiction.md#sherlock-holmes-stories)
	+ You might look at the The *Strand Magazine* items digitized in the [ProQuest British Periodicals database](https://www.proquest.com/publication/1984?OpenUrlRefId=info:xri/sid:primo&accountid=14963&parentSessionId=rOxoHB9q9nPlnJvCL9baHd5zSqxGqA2UKDXlp36H3L0%3D&decadeSelected=1900%20-%201909&yearSelected=1891&monthSelected=07&issueNameSelected=01891Y07Y01%2423Jul%2B1891%243b%2B%2BVol.%2B2) Note that ProQuest digitized the *volumes* of the *Strand* (each of which contained six individual issues. (You might use Zotero and the Zotero browser extension to save bibliographic metadata for other entries)
	+ You might browse through facsimiles volumes of *The Strand* in [HathiTrust](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000642318) or  [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/thestrandmagazine?tab=collection&query=Strand&sort=date&and%5B%5D=year%3A%5B1891+TO+1925%5D)
+ If you're interested in the detective story in the *Strand* and beyond...
	+ You might look at the a subset of the  "author" or "story" CSV files in Adam Hammond and Simon Stern’s [“The Birth of The Modern Detective Story” dataset](https://www.adamhammond.com/bmds/). The dataset includes a collection of 439 texts, and two CSV files: one with metadata on authors and one the project team's annotations of these stories. You can explore and filter the BMDS dataset in [this Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1w-kMR66pQtYdMoDsBK1gSQDIxcTCrzp8?usp=sharing). 
		+ For instance: what can we learn by looking at patterns in the *titles* of early detective fiction? 	
+ If you'r interested in editions and rewritings of *The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes*
	+ You might use Zotero, the Zotero Browser extension and [WorldCat](https://search.worldcat.org/) to track down and save bibliographic data on different reprintings of *The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes* 
	+ You might look at non-digital data:
		+  Richard Lancelyn Green and John Michael Gibson, *A bibliography of A. Conan Doyle* (Oxford: Clarendon Press ; New York : Oxford University Press, 1983). Olin Library Stacks: Call Number ; Z8240 .G73 1983
		+ *A catalogue of original manuscripts, and first and other important editions of the tales of Sherlock Holmes, as written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Together with important biographies, pastiches, articles, etc., and a few extraordinary association and unique items.* (New York, N.Y. : Scribner Book Store; 1943) Available in Wesleyan Special Collections & Archives, Call Number: YYF D75 2S
