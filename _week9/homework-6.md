# Homework 6: Project brainstorming & practicing data collection 

This two-part homework is designed to give you time for brainstorming and collaborating on final projects as well as practice building and curating your own dataset around specific research questions.

NOTE: The only part that I ask that you submit are your project brainstorming posts rom part #1!

## Part 1: Project brainstorming!

1. Please **post at least one realistic project idea** that you'd be interested in (and sign your name) on [our project brainstorming GoogleDoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Co0Wni6ktOCFIwtMkq5aynPguGVLOkfbUBpAS-YR3_g/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.k217upgfhgy8)
	+ You might think about datasets we've worked with that you you were especially interested in, or example projects from the project critique that you found intriguing. Do you have a burning research question or data visualization that you would like to explore as part of your final project?
	+ Remember that your projects do not need to be web-based, or even computational! You might, for instance create a hand-drawn visualization, in the style of one of our artists books, or [Stephanie Posavec's data art](https://www.stefanieposavec.com/writing-without-words)
2.  Please **also add one comment to another classmate's post** that you would be interested in collaborating on. Starting next week you will be forming project groups.

## Part 2: Collecting a mini dataset

**Practice collecting a small dataset**. You get to decide the focus: on a subset of Arthur Conan Doyle's detective fiction, on a subset of other work published in *The Strand*, on other British magazines from the 1890s, on a set of metadata, etc.  It can be a folder of plain text files on your computer, a spreadsheet with metadata about, a set of PDFs, a set of printed out images--let your research question guide the work.

As you collect your sources, remember to record any relevant metadata.

Some suggestions: 

+ If you're interested in creating a collection of collection of plain text files–...
	+ You might download a set of plain text files of individual stories from Christoph Ender’s [“The Complete Sherlock Holmes Canon”](https://sherlock-holm.es/)
	+ You might download the plain text of Doyle's fiction published in book form from from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/69)
+ If you are interested in the Sherlock Holmes stories as they appeared  in *The Strand Magazine* ...
	+ You may use [HathiTrust](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000642318) to download either plaintext or PDF versions of The *Strand Magazine* in HathiTrust libraries
		+ Link to the [locations of particular stories in HathiTrust](https://github.com/sceckert/Data-and-Culture-Fall-2024/blob/main/_week8/detective-fiction.md#sherlock-holmes-stories)
		+ To download the plain text or PDF of pages from HathiTrust, first click "Log in" in the upper righthand corner. (It will prompt you to sign in through Wesleyan University Library.
			+  Then click on the "Download" button lefthand menu, and then select plain text. Repeat this step, selecting the PDF. 
			+ To download **more than one page**, check the squares that appear along the righthand pane above the rotate and + / - signs. (Checking a square indicates you've selected that page)
	+ You might consider:
		+ What if we wanted to analyze and compare just the language on first page of each of the twelve stories in *The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes* and *The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes*?
		+ What if we wanted to compare how the pieces appeared visually on the page-- the kinds of illustrations that appear? The scenes that are illustrated? (Do the kinds of scenes illustrated in Sherlock Holmes change over time––do we see more or less Holmes at Home)?
+ If you're interested in the other work (fiction, advertisements, poetry), other authors or illustrators that appeared in a given volume of *The Strand* alongside Doyle's fiction...
	+ You might examine the [list of all fiction published in the *Strand* between 1891-1901 (assembled by the *At the Circulating Library* team)](https://www.victorianresearch.org/atcl/show_periodical.php?jid=122)
	+  You might consult the indexes to particular *issues*  by looking at the [transcriptions of the tables of contents for individual issues of *The Strand*](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Strand_Magazine#Volumes_with_readable_content) on WikiSource
		+  Link to the [transcriptions of tables of contents for particular issues](https://github.com/sceckert/Data-and-Culture-Fall-2024/blob/main/_week8/detective-fiction.md#sherlock-holmes-stories)
	+ You might look at the The *Strand Magazine* items digitized in the [ProQuest British Periodicals database](https://www.proquest.com/publication/1984?OpenUrlRefId=info:xri/sid:primo&accountid=14963&parentSessionId=rOxoHB9q9nPlnJvCL9baHd5zSqxGqA2UKDXlp36H3L0%3D&decadeSelected=1900%20-%201909&yearSelected=1891&monthSelected=07&issueNameSelected=01891Y07Y01%2423Jul%2B1891%243b%2B%2BVol.%2B2) Note that ProQuest digitized the *volumes* of the *Strand* (each of which contained six individual issues. (You might use Zotero and the Zotero browser extension to save bibliographic metadata for other entries)
	+ You might browse through facsimiles volumes of *The Strand* in [HathiTrust](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000642318) or  [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/thestrandmagazine?tab=collection&query=Strand&sort=date&and%5B%5D=year%3A%5B1891+TO+1925%5D)
+ If you're interested in the detective story in the *Strand* and beyond...
	+ You might look at the a subset of the  "author" or "story" CSV files in Adam Hammond and Simon Stern’s [“The Birth of The Modern Detective Story” dataset](https://www.adamhammond.com/bmds/). The dataset includes a collection of 439 texts, and two CSV files: one with metadata on authors and one the project team's annotations of these stories. You can explore and filter the BMDS dataset in [this Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1w-kMR66pQtYdMoDsBK1gSQDIxcTCrzp8?usp=sharing). 
		+ For instance: what can we learn by looking at patterns in the *titles* of early detective fiction?
		+ Or you might use the publication and publisher information from the BMDS dataset and other sources to compare authors and illustrators published in *The Strand* with other magazines.
+ If you're interested in editions and rewritings of *The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes*...
	+ You might use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), the Zotero browser extension and [WorldCat](https://search.worldcat.org/) to track down and save bibliographic data on different reprintings of *The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes* 
	+ You might look at non-digital data:
		+  Richard Lancelyn Green and John Michael Gibson, *A bibliography of A. Conan Doyle* (Oxford: Clarendon Press ; New York : Oxford University Press, 1983). Olin Library Stacks: Call Number ; Z8240 .G73 1983
		+ *A catalogue of original manuscripts, and first and other important editions of the tales of Sherlock Holmes, as written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Together with important biographies, pastiches, articles, etc., and a few extraordinary association and unique items.* (New York, N.Y. : Scribner Book Store; 1943) Available in Wesleyan Special Collections & Archives, Call Number: YYF D75 2S
+  If you're interested in the social life of literature and the field of 1890s-1910s magazines beyond*The Strand* ...
	+  You might use the [Yellow Nineties Project](https://1890s.ca/magazine_rack/) to assemble a dataset from other 1890s-era Victorian illustrated and artists' magazines. Or you might use the project's [Y90's Personagraphy database](https://personography.1890s.ca/using-this-site/) to assembly biographical metadata about contributors and publishers in the 8 magazines in their dates
	+  You might look at the 1910 issue of the *Strand Magazine* in comparison to the other 23 British and American magazines from 1910-1911 held in the [Modernist Journals Projects](https://modjourn.org/journal/strand-magazine/#comprise)
		+  The Modernist Journals Project's MJP Lab also has smaller, machine-readable datasets for 13 of their periodicals available on Sourceforge. Here is an [overview of that data](https://sourceforge.net/p/mjplab/home/Home/) and here are [links to the individual folders](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mjplab/files/) with the metadata on titles, contributors, editors and full text transcriptions of each magazine issue.
	+  Or you might compare issues of the *Strand* to a different kind of magazine: the all-fiction, pulpwood magazines in the U.S. using the [Pulp Magazines Project](https://www.pulpmags.org/) digital archive.
