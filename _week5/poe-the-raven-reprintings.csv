This appearance is usually found as a bound volume, with no clear indication of the various issue months and often with a title page bearing the imprint date of 1846, but H&C and Mabbott correctly identified the issue as December 1845. At least one copy in wrappers has been seen, but even then it was collected with pages that would have been issued in previous months. (Although Mabbott considers this to be an authorized reprint, it resembles the printing from the Broadway Journal rather than reflecting the recent changes made for RAOP. Had he authorized or requested the reprint, Poe would presumably have provided the most recent version, with a number of notable changes, rather than an earlier, inferior text. Because there is no clear designation of monthly issues in the volume, the presumed date of December 1845 is based on the reprint appearing at the end of the volume for 1845, although it appears that the remaining 5 issues were actually sent out in August 1845. The pages, including “The Raven,” were reissued with a new title page in 1846, still as The Literary Emporium, but now in book form, and again in book form about 1848 as The Pearl Offering.
