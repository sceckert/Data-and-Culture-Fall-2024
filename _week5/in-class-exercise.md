# "The Raven" goes viral: mapping reprinting with Palladio


I've assembled a rough dataset for us of Poe reprintings, drawing on:

+ the [Johns Hopkins Exhibition catalog description](https://exhibits.library.jhu.edu/exhibits/show/enigmatic-edgar/master-of-variety/the-raven) for the Oc. 4, 2016-Feb 5, 2017 exhibition of Poe materials from their Susan Jaffe Tane collection
+ The Baltimore Poe Society's bibliography of editions, impressions and reprintings of "The Raven": [https://www.eapoe.org/works/info/pp073.htm](https://www.eapoe.org/works/info/pp073.htm)
+ Additional searches in Chronicling America for matching lines.

This Poe dataset can be found here: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sceckert/Data-and-Culture-Fall-2024/refs/heads/main/_week5/poe-the-raven-reprintings.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sceckert/Data-and-Culture-Fall-2024/refs/heads/main/_week5/poe-the-raven-reprintings.csv).

Take a look at the dataset: what do we notice?

If you'd like, you can right click and save the CSV file. Open up the file using VSCode or a simple text editor. 

Then, navigate to the tool for creating exploratory maps and visualizing simple datasets, [Palladio](https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio-app/). Palladio is a tool developed by the Stanford Center for Humanities + Design. 

Navigate to the following: https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio-app/#/upload

Either paste the link to the [Poe dataset] (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sceckert/Data-and-Culture-Fall-2024/refs/heads/main/_week5/poe-the-raven-reprintings.csv`) into the the "Load .csv or spreadsheet"

Then click "Load".

You should see a little pane with all your datafields. Give your project a title. Then in the upper menu, click "Map" and then "New Layer" in the right hand menu.

In Places, select "Coordinates" (This is drawing on a field of loose coordinates for the place locations of various re-printings). Check the box to size points by number of counts. Then click Add layer.

On the very bottom of the screen, click the "Timeline" button.

Try dragging and selecting different parts of the timeline. Try hovering over points (and maybe consulting the original datasource for the information)

Talk with your partner: What patterns do we notice?
